# Assignment 7 - jQuery

## Resources
- [GitHowTo](https://githowto.com/merging_back_to_master): I needed some help with how to successfully merge a branch into the master branch.

## Deductions
> I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
- This assignment was pretty straight forward. I'm definitely glad to have the merge experience because we haven't done that yet.
- I do look forward to learning how to use tags on with git!
